# raytracer_rs

This is a simple ray tracer based on the raytracing book here.[Ray Tracing in One Weekend
 by Peter Shirley](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). I used this project to *learn* Rust from scratch - this code can be terrible - sorry if you saw this and weren't thrilled.


The project is under development, instructions for running will appear here later.


Additional features that I would like to implement in the course of the project:

* Texture mapping (e.g. earth and moon textures below)
* Lighting
* Parallel rendering - will use all CPU cores for best performance
* Read scene data from JSON file
* Render a sky texture
